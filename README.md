# Pechay-Disease-Classification
Pechay-Disease-Classification task is to classify if a Pechay has an Overall Chlorosis, Interveinal Chlorosis, Purpling and Necrosis Disease. 

The Client folder consists of a main python file, and when run, it will show the GUI made in Qt Designer. I used PyQt5 to make the application functionalities. 

The Server folder consists of the deep learning model used for predicition and the python file to use the model and return back the results to the client.

*Note: The deep learning model used is just a dummy model so that I can see if the client and server is running correctly. I am in the process of building the dataset and creating the model. I cannot upload my model since it is very large.*
